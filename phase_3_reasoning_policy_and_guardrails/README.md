# Phase 3: Reasoning Policy and Guardrails

Phase 3 specifies the agent’s interaction policy and verification behaviors, defines expected failure modes (e.g., uncertainty, missing evidence, tool errors, ambiguous queries), and establishes guardrails that determine when the agent should ask questions, refuse, escalate, or switch strategies.

This phase includes prompts and artifacts derived from **3.1 Reasoning** and **3.2 Policy and guardrails**.

Helper agents draft candidate reasoning policies and guardrail behaviors and iteratively revise them based on SME and developer feedback, explicitly designing how the agent behaves.

Phase 3 makes expert-like reasoning and safety behavior explicit and reviewable.
