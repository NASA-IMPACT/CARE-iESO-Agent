# Phase 2: Key Information Elicitation

Phase 2 captures the key inputs required to encode expert practice before detailed
agent behavior or prompt architecture is designed.

This phase focuses on three core elements:

- **Tools (2.1):** What tools are available, what they do, and how they should be used
- **Context (2.2):** Authoritative domain knowledge, assumptions, terminology, and sources
- **Output Format (2.3):** What the agent must produce and how results should be structured

Helper agents conduct structured elicitation by generating targeted questions and
drafting the Tools, Context, and Output artifacts in consistent Markdown format for
human validation. This process converts tacit subject-matter expert knowledge into
explicit, reviewable engineering inputs.

The outcome of Phase 2 is a set of validated specifications that define the agent’s
operational environment and expected deliverables, forming the grounding layer for
subsequent reasoning policy and prompt design.
