# Phase 1: Scope and Decompose

Phase 1 establishes the foundation for the agent by defining its purpose, intended users,
workflow boundaries, and constraints.

This phase applies agent deconstruction to determine what must be explicitly specified
for interaction policy, domain grounding, tool orchestration, and evaluation before any
prompt or implementation work begins.

In Phase 1, a helper agent drafts an initial set of scoped artifacts—such as constraints,
decomposition targets, and intended users—to seed review by subject matter experts (SMEs)
and developers. This process converts an initial agent idea into explicit, shared design
targets and constraints.

The outcome of Phase 1 is a reviewable specification starting point that aligns
stakeholders on what the agent is meant to do, what it is not meant to do, and what
decisions must remain under human control.
