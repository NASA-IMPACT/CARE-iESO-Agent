# Phase 4: Prompt Architecture and Tool-Orchestration Implementation

Phase 4 translates the artifacts into an implementable agent prompt designed using patterns from the prompt catalog (White, J.,2023) grounding injection strategy, tool schemas, routing logic, and retry policies.

The helper agent generates a prompt aligned with the input artifacts, and implementation is treated as a structured translation of artifacts into a working prompt for the agent.

Consequently, Phase 4 treats the prompt as an engineered output derived from approved artifacts, not ad hoc iteration.
